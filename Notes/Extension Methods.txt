Extension Methods enable you to "extend" existing types by adding new methods,
as if they were part of the original.


this is done by:
	Static Method inside a Static Class.
	the 'this' keyword before the first parameter

Example:

public static Transform[] AllChildren(this Transform tr, bool includeInactive) {
	if (tr.Children() == null) return null;

	return tr.GetComponentsInChildren<Transform>(includeInactive);
}

this adds AllChildren() to the base functionality of Transform, because of the 'this' infront of it/
to access:
	transform.AllChildrent(true)
